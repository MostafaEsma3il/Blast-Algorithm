-- BLAST ALGORITHM
The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm is used to compare nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and identify regions of similarity. 
It employs a heuristic approach for fast and efficient searches, making it highly useful in bioinformatics for identifying homologous sequences. 
BLAST works by finding short matches (seeds) and extending them to generate high-scoring sequence alignments.
